### Problem statement: 

    You are given an array of n+2 elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to n. And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

### Algorithm:

- **Method 1 (Basic):**
  - **Approach:**
    - Use two loops. In the outer loop, pick elements one by one and count the number of occurrences of the picked element in the inner loop.

    - This method doesn’t use the other useful data provided in questions like range of numbers is between 1 to n and there are only two repeating elements.

- **Method 2 (Use Count array):**
  - **Approach:**
    - Traverse the array once. While traversing, keep track of count of all elements in the array using a temp array count[] of size n, when you see an element whose count is already set, print it as duplicate.
    - This method uses the range given in the question to restrict the size of count[], but doesn’t use the data that there are only two repeating elements.

- **Method 3 (Make two equations):**
  - **Approach:**
    - Let the numbers which are being repeated are X and Y. We make two equations for X and Y and the simple task left is to solve the two equations.
    - We know the sum of integers from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2 and product is n!. We calculate the sum of input array, when this sum is subtracted from n(n+1)/2, we get X + Y because X and Y are the two numbers missing from set [1..n]. Similarly calculate product of input array, when this product is divided from n!, we get X*Y. Given sum and product of X and Y, we can find easily out X and Y.

- **Method 4 (Use XOR):**
  - **Approach:**
    - Let the repeating numbers be X and Y, if we xor all the elements in the array and all integers from 1 to n, then the result is X xor Y.
    - The 1’s in binary representation of X xor Y is corresponding to the different bits between X and Y. Suppose that the kth bit of X xor Y is 1, we can xor all the elements in the array and all integers from 1 to n, whose kth bits are 1. The result will be one of X and Y.

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Naive approach
    void printRepeating(int arr[], int size){ 
        int i, j; 
        printf(" Repeating elements are "); 
        for(i = 0; i < size; i++) 
            for(j = i + 1; j < size; j++) 
            if(arr[i] == arr[j]) 
                cout << arr[i] << " "; 
    }  

    // Using count array:
    void printRepeating(int arr[], int size){  
        int *count = new int[sizeof(int)*(size - 2)];  
        int i;  
            
        cout << " Repeating elements are ";  
        for(i = 0; i < size; i++){  
            if(count[arr[i]] == 1)  
                cout << arr[i] << " ";  
            else
                count[arr[i]]++;  
        }  
    }  

    // By making equations
    void printRepeating(int arr[], int size){  
        int S = 0; /* S is for sum of elements in arr[] */
        int P = 1; /* P is for product of elements in arr[] */
        int x, y; /* x and y are two repeating elements */
        int D; /* D is for difference of x and y, i.e., x-y*/
        int n = size - 2, i;  
        
        /* Calculate Sum and Product of all elements in arr[] */
        for(i = 0; i < size; i++){  
            S = S + arr[i];  
            P = P*arr[i];  
        }      
            
        S = S - n*(n+1)/2; /* S is x + y now */
        P = P/fact(n);     /* P is x*y now */
            
        D = sqrt(S*S - 4*P); /* D is x - y now */
            
        x = (D + S)/2;  
        y = (S - D)/2;  
            
        cout<<"The two Repeating elements are "<<x<<" & "<<y;  
    }  
    
    int fact(int n){  
        return (n == 0)? 1 : n*fact(n-1);  
    }

    // By using XOR
    void printRepeating(int arr[], int size){  
        int Xor = arr[0]; /* Will hold Xor of all elements */
        int set_bit_no; /* Will have only single set bit of Xor */
        int i;  
        int n = size - 2;  
        int x = 0, y = 0;  
            
        /* Get the Xor of all elements in arr[] and {1, 2 .. n} */
        for(i = 1; i < size; i++)  
            Xor ^= arr[i];  
        for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)  
            Xor ^= i;  
        
        /* Get the rightmost set bit in set_bit_no */
        set_bit_no = Xor & ~(Xor-1);  
        
        /* Now divide elements in two sets by comparing rightmost set  
        bit of Xor with bit at same position in each element. */
        for(i = 0; i < size; i++)  
        {  
            if(arr[i] & set_bit_no)  
            x = x ^ arr[i]; /*Xor of first set in arr[] */
            else
            y = y ^ arr[i]; /*Xor of second set in arr[] */
        }  
        for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)  
        {  
            if(i & set_bit_no)

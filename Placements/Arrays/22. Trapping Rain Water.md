### Problem statement: 

    Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

### Algorithm:

- **Method 1 :** This is a simple solution to the above problem.
  - **Approach:** The idea is to traverse every array element and find the highest bars on left and right sides. Take the smaller of two heights. The difference between the smaller height and height of the current element is the amount of water that can be stored in this array element.
  - **Algorithm:**
    - Traverse the array from start to end.
    - For every element, traverse the array from start to that index and find the maximum height (a) and traverse the array from the current index to end and find the maximum height (b).
    - The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(a,b) – array[i], add this value to total amount of water stored
    - Print the total amount of water stored.

- **Method 2:** This is an efficient solution to the above problem.
  - **Approach:** In the previous solution, to find the highest bar on the left and right, array traversal is needed which reduces the efficiency of the solution. To make this efficient one must pre-compute the highest bar on the left and right of every bar in linear time. Then use these pre-computed values to find the amount of water in every array element.
  - **Algorithm:** 
    - Create two array left and right of size n. create a variable max_ = INT_MIN.
    - Run one loop from start to end. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign left[i] = max_
    - Update max_ = INT_MIN.
    - Run another loop from end to start. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign right[i] = max_
    - Traverse the array from start to end.
    - The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(a,b) – array[i],(where a = left[i] and b = right[i]) add this value to total amount of water stored
    - Print the total amount of water stored.

**Space Optimization for above Solution:** Instead of maintaing two arrays of size n for storing left and right max of each element, maintain two variables to store the maximum till that point. Since water trapped at any element = min(max_left, max_right) – arr[i]. Calculate water trapped on smaller element out of A[lo] and A[hi] first and move the pointers till lo doesn’t cross hi.
  
### Code:

``` cpp

    // Naive solution
    int maxWater(int arr[], int n){
        // To store the maximum water  
        // that can be stored 
        int res = 0; 
        
        // For every element of the array 
        for (int i = 1; i < n-1; i++) { 
            
            // Find the maximum element on its left 
            int left = arr[i]; 
            for (int j=0; j<i; j++) 
            left = max(left, arr[j]); 
            
            // Find the maximum element on its right    
            int right = arr[i]; 
            for (int j=i+1; j<n; j++) 
            right = max(right, arr[j]);  
            
        // Update the maximum water     
        res = res + (min(left, right) - arr[i]);    
        } 
        return res;  
    }  

    // Efficient algorithm
    int findWater(int arr[], int n){ 
        // left[i] contains height of tallest bar to the 
        // left of i'th bar including itself 
        int left[n]; 
    
        // Right [i] contains height of tallest bar to 
        // the right of ith bar including itself 
        int right[n]; 
    
        // Initialize result 
        int water = 0; 
    
        // Fill left array 
        left[0] = arr[0]; 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) 
            left[i] = max(left[i - 1], arr[i]); 
    
        // Fill right array 
        right[n - 1] = arr[n - 1]; 
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) 
            right[i] = max(right[i + 1], arr[i]); 
    
        // Calculate the accumulated water element by element 
        // consider the amount of water on i'th bar, the 
        // amount of water accumulated on this particular 
        // bar will be equal to min(left[i], right[i]) - arr[i] . 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
            water += min(left[i], right[i]) - arr[i]; 
    
        return water; 
    } 

    // Space optimized solution
    int findWater(int arr[], int n){ 
        // initialize output 
        int result = 0;
